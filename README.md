testing out some JS scraping

## install chrome wsl2:

## Ideas:
- recent map vetoes from both teams
  - want to know possible map picks
    - get map ban and pick %?
- team matchups, who has been beating the other more?
- player ratings, who stands out?
- who did these teams beat to get to this position in the tournament?
- an indication of teamwork?
  - flash assists? (naphony)
